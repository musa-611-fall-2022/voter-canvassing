# Canvassing Tool PRD

## Purpose

Empower a canvasser to help ensure that people are informed about voting.

## Features

I'm thinking a mobile-friendly website with a map you can interact with that each location pops up the details a canvasser would need before they visited that address and then an interactive pop up to add info on the outcome of the session.

* Mobile-friendly website
* Map marker for each residence
* Clicking on a map marker will pop up details about...
  * Voter(s) in the residence
  * Previous interactions with the voter(s)
  * Recall information that was previously entered
* Ability to add information such as...
  * Mail-in vs. in-person voting plan
  * Mail-in ballot received or not
  * If they are prepared to vote in person othewise
  * Whether the person still lives where they are
  * Whether the person doesn't want to talk to canvassers
  * Preferred language
  * If the voter might need non-English language assistance from another committeeperson 
  * Whether I/the canvasser should follow up
  * Notes/misc.
* Prioritized list of where to go next
* Color coded markers based on status (not yet visited, need to return, additional action required, etc.)
* Some notion of apartment vs single-family house

And maybe additional things like:
* Dashboard showing summarized information from both the voter rolls and from your interactions
* Gamification like percentage progress through a list
* Further filters
